Chaos Core is a tactical roguelite set entirely within a massive, procedurally generated dungeon — the Chaos Core — a portal to the chaotic realm of Tartaraxis, ruled by Aphygor. Players control Aeriss and her Company of Quills as they descend through the dungeon's floors, fighting tactical battles, capturing key rooms, and upgrading their base camp to survive deeper runs. The goal is to reach the Core Room and defeat Aphygor's emissary before chaos engulfs the world.

Genre & Inspiration: Tactical RPG + Roguelite, inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Into the Breach, and deck-building systems from games like Slay the Spire.

Unique Selling Points: Strategic turn-based combat with small, intense maps; procedural run structure; persistent base camp within the dungeon; deck-building integrated into unit skills; free movement exploration with light enemies.
